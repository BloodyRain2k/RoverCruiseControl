RoverCruiseControl
==================

If you ever wanted to spare your fingers the pain of holding down the forward button while driving a stock rover then this is the right addon.

Due to my dislike of having to add parts to my crafts for things that are merely function additions this thing attaches itself to every ModuleCommand containing part, in short, pretty much every commandpod you have.

You can then just right click any of them to toggle the RCC on or off, alternatively you can press O which will also try to keep the current speed as best as the detected wheels can.

This detection is not perfect though and if you have some highspeed wheels that aren't on the ground and currently driving with slower ones then the automatic set speed will be off.

If you only have one type of wheels on your craft it should be pretty close though. Also the entry for de/activating only shows up if wheels are detected, to not clutter up the menu for unaffected crafts.

The plugin dll is under bin\Debug and it's the only thing needed.
